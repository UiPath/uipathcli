## Security

UiPath takes the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organization [UiPath](https://github.com/UiPath).

Every UiPath product is designed and developed with security in mind.
Security is built directly into our development lifecycle, by performing both automated security scans and red team style penetration tests on every build.
We submit our releases to independent third-party review at the highest level to ensure that our security is more than trusted.
